# Oximetry Simulation

PIBITI project of Oximetry Simulation based on MK model.

This repository contains the .py file, but the .exe can be found [here.](https://unbbr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/170012441_aluno_unb_br/EU5jLfTJgiFHnqUn9Hge1HkB9XJ8LaUPHc73RS0S4xBwHw?e=Hk37F9)

There is an issue with the Numpy current libs which Pyinstaller cannot find the dlls. That's the reason of a single large .exe with a long initalization time.
