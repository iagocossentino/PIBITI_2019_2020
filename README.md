# Oximetry Simulation

PIBITI project of Oximetry Simulation based on MK model.

This repository contains the .py file, but the .exe can be found [here.](https://unbbr-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/170012441_aluno_unb_br/Etf9EF5JkaNBhhmc_-L3l2ABH8bllloSM5tPRCL5brtzoA?e=B1X2ET)

There is an issue with the Numpy current libs which Pyinstaller cannot find the dlls. That's the reason of a single large .exe with a long initalization time.
